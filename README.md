# Card-Fraud-Detection

In this project I will try to build a Card Fraud Detection System using Logistic Regression Algorithm.
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud .
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
After data Analysis, I found that the dataset is highly unbalanced
with the number of positive class (frauds) accounting less than 0.5% of all transactions.
So, I have used Under-Sampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data.
The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy and F1 score on the test data.
